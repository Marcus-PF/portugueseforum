# ⚙️ Operations & Processes

> 🔧 *A flexible, community-aligned operational framework that blends transparency, collaboration, and digital tooling.*

The **Portuguese Forum of South Africa (PFSA)** is a mission-driven nonprofit with a **community-first, distributed operating model**. It balances grassroots coordination with national execution — supported by agile workflows and cost-efficient tools.

## 🧭 Work Methodology

Forum activities follow a **goal-oriented, feedback-driven model** rooted in real-world community needs:

| Process | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🎯 **Project-Based Planning** | Time-boxed or event-triggered initiatives and campaigns |
| 🔁 **Iterative Collaboration** | Programs evolve through volunteer input and community feedback |
| 🧩 **Multi-Level Coordination** | Regional leads inform national priorities and strategy |
| 🧪 **Data-Informed Decisions** | Reports, metrics, and community surveys shape planning |
| 💬 **Civic Participation** | Members and stakeholders contribute directly to outcomes |

> ⚖️ While PFSA is not corporate in structure, it values operational clarity, responsiveness, and measurable impact.
